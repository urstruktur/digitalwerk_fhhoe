# DigitalWerk FHOOE

## Inciting passion for technology

_DigitalWerk_ pursues the goal of imparting competencies in the field of robotics for any age group, through school and university, and beyond professional life. This will be accomplished through the conception of interdisciplinary, inter-university courses and the development of new approaches to knowledge transfer through public and semi-public events to arouse interest in the topics of robotics and technology and make digitization an interactive experience.

### Role of the University of Applied Sciences Upper Austria

The role of the _Fachhochschule Ober√∂sterreich_ is focused on the development and conduction of new teaching formats but also on reaching a target audience beyond an academic context through public events which impart understanding, appreciation and competencies of technology in the context of digitization. The endeavours are focused on Workpackage 7: knowledge transfer (_AP7: Wissensvermittlung_).
