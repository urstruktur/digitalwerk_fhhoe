# Post project roundup

**Artist**: Flo Amar

**Event**: 9th September 2022, from 18.30 – 19.00, at DH5 as a part of Hedonistika festival

#### Preparation

Before the performance started, Flo went around the installation and asked people to write on a piece of paper something a machine could say to a human or a human would say to a machine. He collected the statements to be used later in the scenes.

#### Warmup

Everybody (roughly 30 people in audience) stood up and did small exercises led by Flo. We started by physical exercises like extending your right arm 5 times, then your left arm, then your right leg, left leg, and shaking our butts. And then did the same exercise with 4 repetitions, then 3, 2, and 1. The next exercise was calling out answers to Flo’s questions as quickly as possible e.g. What is your name?, Favourite drink?, Walle or Terminator?. The last exercise was to close our eyes and follow Flo’s instructions. We had to extend our arms in front of us and pretend there is a magnet between our palms that is attracting them closer and closer. The point of these exercises was to get people prepared and opened enough to join Flo on stage.

#### Scene 1

In the first scene Flo asked for a volunteer. A girl said she could be a broken machine and came on stage. A suggestion from the audience was that she plays a microwave. Flo asked the audience what the twist is, and the answer was that she is a sad microwave. Flo acted as the human who interacted with her. Every now and again he would pick up a random statement from the preparation phase and include it in their scene. Example: He picked up a paper with the statement: Range against the machine. As he read it out loud, the girl playing the microwave started slowly walking away from him. In this he exclaimed “No, no, I meant the fridge.” To her, so she would come back.

The scene displayed a funny switch of power between the user and the machine. Because she was a broken and sad machine, he had to treat her more like a human, ask her what he could do to make her feel better, promising he would cook more and warm up less smelly food etc. By doing so, she eventually warmed up to him, and decided to warm his food as well.

#### Scene 2

The second scene was set up as a reality tv show. Two people from the audience were invited on stage, one being the host of the show, and the other being an inventor of a machine that does not yet exist in our reality. Flo played the part of simultaneous translation into “sign language". Audience chose the invented machine to be an automatic make up applier, and the twist of the machine was that it sometimes made you look like a clown. The inventor got very creative with the idea behind her machine, explaining to us the history of a boxing match where the whole idea first came from. And how the make up tool accidentally gave people a red nose if applied with too much pressure. From then on, she designed the whole machine in a way it could only be applied by punching people in the face, and the specific look was a part of the appeal in her eyes. During all this, Flo acted/mimed out all the aspect of the story in a very expressive and clearly funny way.

Although the idea of the machine was clearly ridiculous, it showed how valuable it was to pretend something already exists and taking ownership of it, and by doing this being able to imagine every single aspect of it into the tiniest detail. An exercise like this could be useful for exploring real ideas in a different setting than usual. It could allow for more spontaneous, instinctive, and intuitive answers to the questions about the product or idea.

#### Scene 3

In scene 3, Flo asked the audience for a very expensive machine we can already buy today. The suggestion was a Nespresso coffee maker. So the setting became a Nespresso shop with Flo acting as the sales person, and a volunteer from the audience played the role of the customer interested in buying the product. As soon as the scene opened, Flo started describing how the machine works by intentionally exaggerating it. He talked about a single special bean that you have to use for a whole cup of watered-down coffee. The machine only works with this bean and the bean only works with this machine. As the scene was unrevealing both actors were picking up suggestions from the preparation stage and included them in the story. When a suggestion of a “lion dance” came up, Flo suggested to the customer that he could perform this dance for him, and that would grant him a discount to the machine. After the actor played out the dance, Flo said the only person to ever do this before was George Clooney, and that is how he got to be the face of the brand. The scene finished with Flo giving the machine, George and the whole brand to the customer.

The scene showed how we can explore one single aspect of an idea or a product in all its’ realism, silliness, ridiculousness, rudeness, etc. Each exchange between the two actors opened another point of view to the selected adjective (in our case: expensive and luxurious). The relaxed setting again allowed for more spontaneous reactions, which often prove to be the most normal and human and could prove useful when applied to the design of real products and/or interactions.

#### Scene 4

The final scene was to act as a part of a manufacturing line. Everybody was invited on stage to perform one repetitive movement. One person started and the next followed. Until a whole production line for an un-existing product was created.
