# Techno-Utopia

A workshop is planned in which we gather with people who

* are interested in Fantasy or Sci-Fi stories,
* are enthusiastic about coming up with ideas for the future and
* want to speculate and work on the future of technology in a playful and creative way.

As a framework, we plan to use a setting that brings together people with similar interests but diverse backgrounds. For this, the festival Next Comic offered a good platform.

The festival focuses on cultural and artistic aspects of comics and their artists, which sets it apart from others that tend to concentrate on the popular or economic side of comics. The focus is also on promoting the Austrian comics scene on the one hand and providing a platform for comics outside the mainstream and related arts on the other.&#x20;

The **goal** of the workshop is to:

* engage people beyond computer science and engineering with technology and the implementation of it
* prototype future technology and our socio-cultural relation to it in a playful setting
* question the status quo of current technology and reflect it through the lens of fictional stories
* reflect on what goal technology development it is guided towards and generate new prospective goals which are aligned with our own wishes
* allow non-techies to envision technology without the constraint of having an engineering degree
* give participants a framework to think about the future
