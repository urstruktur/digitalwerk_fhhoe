# Techno-Utopia

A workshop is planned in which we gather with people who

* are interested in Fantasy or Sci-Fi stories,
* are enthusiastic about coming up with ideas for the future and
* want to speculate and work on the future of technology in a playful and creative way.

As a framework we plan to use a setting which brings together people with similar interest but diverse backgrounds. For this the&#x20;

In contrast to e.g. Comic Con the focus of the Next Comic festival is less in commercial story franchises and more on lesser known and local artists. The festival focuses on cultural and artistic aspects of comics and their artists, which sets it apart from others that tend to concentrate on the popular or economic side of comics. The focus is also on promoting the Austrian comics scene on the one hand and providing a platform for comics outside the mainstream and related arts on the other.&#x20;
