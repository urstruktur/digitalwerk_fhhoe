# Improvised Technology

On September 9th, 2022, a small group of roughly 25 people got together in an atrium in DH5. They gathered around one person standing in the middle gesturing them to come closer.

We’ve invited a local improvisational performer Flo Amar to make an impro theatre about robots. Our brief was “People who act as people interact with people who act as technology.” He was immediately on board and proposed that the audience should be as well. We were sceptical, but excited to see what happens. The perfect venue would be Hedonistika, the festival of automated pleasure. Flo would make a few scenes with participants from the audience, reflecting on our interactions and relationships with technology.

The performance included:

1. Preparation, where Flo asked people to write on a piece of paper something a machine could say to a human, or a human would say to a machine, and collected the statements to be used in the scenes.
2. Warmup, consisting of a few different exercises to get people moving, excited and hopefully willing to join Flo on stage.
3. Four scenes, each in a different form, with a different setting, about a different subject, with different people on stage.

### Scene 1: A broken microwave

Flo asked for the first volunteer. There is a bit of silence, and people looking at each other in anticipation. A woman spoke up and said she could play a broken machine. A suggestion from the audience followed, that she was to play a microwave. A sad microwave. Flo acted as the user who interacted with her. Every now and again he would pick up a random statement from the preparation phase and include it in their scene. Range against the machine, read one of the papers. As soon as he finished saying the words, the microwave started backing away from him. He exclaimed “No, no, I meant the fridge.”

The scene displayed a funny switch of power between the user and the machine. Because she displayed signs of sadness and stubbornness, he started treating her with more empathy. Started treating her more like a human. Ask her what he could do to make her feel better, promising he would cook more. And warm up less food that smells bad. Through what seemed at moments like a conversation between a parent wanting something and a child refusing to do it, they finally found a compromise, she dropped her defences and started working again.

### Scene 2: Automatic make up applier

The second scene was set up as a reality tv show. Two people from the audience were invited on stage, one being the host, the other an inventor of a machine that does not exist in our reality. Flo played the part of simultaneous translation into sign language. The audience chose the invented machine to be an automatic make up applier. But it sometimes made you look like a clown. There was an applause, and the host invited the inventor on stage. The inventor explained the history of a boxing match where she first got the idea. Her make up prototype at the time accidentally gave people a red nose if applied with too much pressure. But from then on, she designed the whole machine in a way it could only be applied by punching people in the face. It was an instant hit. The specific look was a part of the appeal, she reflected. The host asked about some specifics about the development of the device, and as the inventor was explaining them, Flo acted/mimed out all the aspect of the story in a very expressive way.

Although the idea of the device was clearly ridiculous, it showed how valuable it was to pretend something already exists and taking ownership of it, and by doing this being able to imagine every single aspect of it into the tiniest detail. An exercise like this could be useful for exploring real ideas in a different setting than usual. It could allow for more spontaneous, instinctive, and intuitive answers to the questions about a product before it is developed to its final form.

### Scene 3: Nespresso coffee maker

Fort his scene, the audience had to suggest a very expensive machine we can already buy today. The suggestion was a Nespresso coffee maker. The setting became a Nespresso shop with Flo acting as the salesperson, and a volunteer from the audience played the role of the customer interested in buying the product. As soon as the scene opened, Flo started describing how the machine works. He talked about a single special bean that you must use for one cup of watered-down coffee. The machine only works with this bean and the bean only works with this machine. As the scene was unrevealing both actors were picking up suggestions from the preparation stage and included them in the story. When a suggestion of a “lion dance” came up, Flo suggested to the customer that he could perform this dance for him, and that would grant him a discount to the machine. After the actor played out the dance, Flo said the only person to ever do this before was George Clooney, and that is how he got to be the face of the brand.

The scene showed how we can explore one single aspect of a product from various angles including its’ realism, silliness, ridiculousness, rudeness, offensiveness, humour, etc. Each exchange between the two actors opened another point of view on expensive and luxurious products. The relaxed setting allowed for more spontaneous reactions, that could again prove useful when applied to the design of real products and/or interactions.

### Scene 4: A manufacturing line

The final scene was to act as a part of a manufacturing line. Everybody was invited on stage to perform one repetitive movement. One person started and the next followed. Until a whole production line for an un-existing product was created.

Through improvisational scenes, the experiment showed how small but important aspects of interacting with devices became apparent in this setting of spontaneous reactions. The most obvious become the most intuitive. We see a contribution of this performance on one hand through a critical reflection on our use of technology today, and on the other as a potential methodology in ideating new interaction processes with devices.
