# DPP 2021: Culinatronics

Development and conduction of a course as part of the _Interactive Media_ master program at the University of Applied Sciences Upper Austria: Campus Hagenberg.

The students of _Interactive Media_, who are for the most part trained software developers, will learn how to build a physical representation of an idea. By building an idea, designers and developers are challenged to "build to think" and thus gain deeper insights. This course will go beyond early physical prototyping: it is a hands-on introduction to interactive electronics prototyping for students with a variety of backgrounds, including those with no prior experience in electronics. Participants learn basic electronics, microcontroller programming, and physical prototyping. Additionally, the students will be taught where and how to source materials needed for building functional prototypes.

This year's topic was _Culinatronics, a_ portmanteau word composed of culinary, mechanics and electronics. The aim of the topic was to emphasize the importance of delving into personally unacquainted areas of knowledge, as interdisciplinarity is seen as an integral part of prototyping.

The following projects were developed as part of this class:

### Chopsticks Helper

In this project, the students developed an electronically augmented set of chopsticks. It was able to discern different types of food by measuring the resistance of the picked-up object. Additionally, the project integrated a feedback LED to communicate the state of the system to the user. An inertial measurement unit could detect the orientation of the chopsticks and give the user feedback if they are holding it correctly.

### Spice Dispenser

For some people with disabilities, opening and pouring spices can be a huge challenge. The students came up with the idea to build a spice dispenser for regular spices that can easily operate and mount near cooking areas. The machine could precisely control the amount of the dispensed spice. The project included concepts for a switching mechanism to dispense different kinds of spices.

### Conductive Cloth Controlled Candy Catapult

This project is focused on building a candy catapult used in a restaurant to entertain customers waiting for their dish. The team included the tablecloth as a textile input modality. The mechanical catapult is built from Lego Mindstorms components. A cardboard prototype is created as a proof-of-concept for the communication protocol and textile input. The final result is a Lego Mindstorms bot that can move and shoot candies and is connected and controlled by a textile input interface via a wireless connection.

### M\&M Shooter

The student's idea originated in a childhood game, where one person throws popcorn to another person so that they can catch it with their mouth. The team wanted to automate that process and decided to create a physical system that shoots M\&Ms which can be caught by another person.
