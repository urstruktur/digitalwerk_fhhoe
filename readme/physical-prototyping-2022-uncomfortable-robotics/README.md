# DPP 2022: Uncomfortable Devices

Development and conduction of a course as part of the _Interactive Media_ master program at the University of Applied Sciences Upper Austria: Campus Hagenberg.

The students of _Interactive Media_, who are for the most part trained software developers, will learn how to build a physical representation of an idea. By building an idea, designers and developers are challenged to "build to think" and thus gain deeper insights. This course will go beyond early physical prototyping: it is a hands-on introduction to interactive electronics prototyping for students with a variety of backgrounds, including those with no prior experience in electronics. Participants learn basic electronics, microcontroller programming, and physical prototyping. Additionally, the students will be taught where and how to source materials needed for building functional prototypes.

This year included an inter-university collaboration with the Psychologist **Andrea Rezzani** from Free University of Bolzano, a PhD student in Human Computer Interaction.

Additionally a excursion to the **Technisches Museum Wien** and the art-robotics festival **Roboexotica** was realized.
